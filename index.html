						<p>Hi there!
My name is João António Custódio Soares, I'm a 21 years old student from Porto and I'm in the last year (5th) of my Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering in Porto (FEUP), about to start working on my Thesis. I'm originally from Vila Nova de Gaia, where I studied all my life until college. </p>

								<h3>"Uma App para o Joãozinho"</h3>
								<p>Cross-Platform Mobile game developed for the course of "Laboratório de Gestão de Projectos" at FEUP. A project suggested by the non-profit organization "Um Lugar para o Joãozinho" with the purpose of gathering funds in order to rebuild, requalify and improve the pediatric wing of Hospital S. Joao in Porto. The project was developed using the  <a href="https://unity3d.com/pt">Unity</a> framework, and was meant to use the concept of gamification to incite users to donate to the organization.
								My team's colaboration in this project was discontinued after the course was done and continued by the organization.<br/>

								<h3>Marketing Plan for "Up2Fit" Gym</h3>
								<p>This project is not related with technology at all, it was developed for the course "Marketing" at FEUP and it's objective was to make a Marketing Strategy Analysis of a real business. I decided to showcase this project since it's very different from my other projects and it taught me a lot about the importance of marketing in a real life situation. This study included devicing a marketing plan, analysing the internal and external enviornment of the small gym, analysing the customers and market segment and, finally, defining a marketing strategy accordingly. For this study we used real data provided by the owner and the final strategic decisions were really implemented to (hopefully) help the business grow.
								<br/>Find out more about the gym at their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/up2fitginasio/">facebook page</a>.</p>

								<h3>Up2Manage</h3>
								<p>Information system using the <a href="http://pt.primaverabss.com/pt/">PRIMAVERA ERP</a>. This project was developed for the course of "Sistemas de Informação" at FEUP and the goal was to understand the complexity of organizational Enterprise systems. The theme was Sales Force Automation so we developed an interactive dashboard webapp to help the Sales Team design sales routes, accept tasks layed out by their Supervisors, input sales data, create reservations and complete Orders. This app would work with the enterprise server dealing with product stock and any data irrelevant for the Sales Team making their jobs easier and more efficient.<br/>

								<h3>Places4All</h3>
								<p>Website to evaluate places and locations according to their acessibility to users with limited mobility. This project was developed for the "Coding for Social Impact" project in the "Laboratório de Desenvolvimento de Software" course at FEUP. This website would combine official audits with user reviews and ratings for different places, keeping the evaluation up to date and providing real-time live information on obstacles on route to access the location. This website was developed using ASP.NET since it was mostly for display purposes, and we developed a small Android app to be used on the official audits, where a certified user could answer a comlpete survey and upload pictures to prove it's ratings.<br/>

						<span class="image right"><img src="images/lgp.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<li>I speak and write English fluently (as well as my native language Portuguese) and I've gained a lot of experience writing technically during my studies. I've also become quite good at presentations, altough I do get a litle nervous in the moments before, but I've also learned how to overcome it.
						</li><br/><br/>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/softskills.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<li>At a more personal level, I have great soft skills meaning I can get along really well very easily with anyone. I'm a very colaborative and communicative person, great at working with a team. I can be very good at brainstorming and in the creative process either contributing with original ideas (some better than others) or helping moderate and promote discussion. Altought I'm not the most organized person (working on it!) I think my skill set makes me a fitting leader since I'm good at managing people and handle with pressure and responsability graciously. </li><br/>

							<h2>More about me</h2>
							</header>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pspic1.jpg" alt="" /></span>I've always been very keen on technology and wanted to be an engineer ever since I can remember. I've always loved Maths and solving problems so it seemed like the obvious choice. I decided on enrolling in this Masters on my last year of highschool because I knew it was a great area to study and that it complemented my love for technology, while giving me positive prospections for the future and a vast spectrum of possible career choices.<br/><br/>My interest in programming has been growing exponentially ever since I got (reasonably) good at it and I've been working on improving myself to be able to solve problems with an elegant and adequate solution across the widest spectrum of areas in software development possible.<br/><br/><span class="image left"><img src="images/pspic2.jpg" alt="" /></span>Technological wise, my academic studies have layed out the theory bases I required to understand any problem I come across with, and left me with experience and comfort in many programming languages and software development tools so I can solve these problems with ease. If I can't, it has also taught me how to research and learn what I need by myself making me a very quick learner who can easily adapt to shifting circumstances.<br/><br/>The areas I'm most interested in are Software Engineering and Development, Project Management, Data Science and Data Mining. I'm also interested in Mobile and Web development (mainly backend and database management, but I've been working on my front end and web design skills lately).
							<br/><br/>
							On my personal time, I've always really enjoyed going to the beach and spending time outdoors, preferably with my friends. I also like to read (Booklist coming soon!) and watch movies (checkout my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/joaosoares12/">letterboxd profile</a> where I keep a list of my favourite movies, I'm always open to suggestions!).<br/><br/>
							I also really love dogs &#x1F415;
