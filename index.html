						<p>Hi there!
My name is João António Custódio Soares, I'm a 21 years old student from Porto and I'm in the last year (5th) of my Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering in Porto (FEUP), about to start working on my Thesis. I'm originally from Vila Nova de Gaia, where I studied all my life until college. </p>

							<h2>Major Competences</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Experienced in Scrum and Agile Methods and in working with specialized software for project management like Pivotal Tracker and Scraim.<br/><br/>
						Experienced in the following technologies: Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, XML, VDM++, Scheme, Ruby, AngularJs, NodeJs, Prolog and SQL;
						Experience in using frameworks like .NET, jQuery, Ionic and Unity;
						Experience in different database management systems like : MySQL, SQL Server and PostgreSQL;
						Academic Experience managing software development projects.<br/><br/>
						I speak and write English fluently (as well as my mother tongue Portuguese) and I've gained alot of experience writting technically during my studies. I've also become quite good at presentations, altough I do get a litle nervous in the moments before, but I've also learned how to overcome it.
						<br/><br/>
						At a more personal level, I have great soft skills meaning I can get along really well very easily with anyone. I'm a very colaborative and communicative person, great at working with a team. I can be very good at brainstorming and in the creative process either contributing with original ideas (some better than others) or helping moderate and promote discussion. Altought I'm not the most organized person (working on it!) I think my skill set makes me a fitting leader since I'm good at managing people and handle with pressure and responsability graciously. </p>

							<h2>More about me</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I've always been very keen on technology and wanted to be an engineer ever since I can remember. I've always loved Maths and solving problems so it seemed like the obvious choice. I decided on enrolling in this Masters on my last year of highschool because I knew it was a great area to study and that it complemented my love for technology, while giving me positive prospections for the future and a vast spectrum of possible career choices.<br/><br/>My interest in programming has been growing exponentially ever since I got (reasonably) good at it and I've been working on improving myself to be able to solve problems with an elegant and adequate solution across the widest spectrum of areas in software development possible.<br/><br/>Technological wise, my academic studies have layed out the theory bases I required to understand any problem I come across with, and left me with experience and comfort in many programming languages and software development tools so I can solve these problems with ease. If I can't, it has also taught me how to research and learn what I need by myself making me a very quick learner who can easily adapt to shifting circumstances.<br/><br/>The areas I'm most interested in are Software Engineering and Development,and Project Management. I'm also interested in mobile and web development (mainly backend and databases, but I've been working on my front-end and web design skills).
							<br/><br/>
							On my personal time, I've always really enjoyed going to the beach and spending time outdoors, preferably with my friends. I also like to read (Booklist coming soon!) and watch movies (checkout my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/joaosoares12/">letterboxd profile</a> where I keep a list of my favourite movies, I'm always open to suggestions!).
