						<p>Hi there!
My name is João António Custódio Soares, I'm a 22 years old student from Porto and I'm in the last year (5th) of my Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering in Porto (FEUP), about to present and defend my Thesis (July 19th). I'm originally from Vila Nova de Gaia, where I studied all my life until college. </p>

								<h2><bold>Master Thesis and Scientific Article</bold></h2>
								<p>
								My dissertation work for my Master Thesis is called<bold>Automatic Model Transformation of UML Sequence Diagrams to Coloured Petri Nets</bold> and has been supervised by Professor João Pascoal Faria and Professor Bruno Lima at FEUP.</br></br>
								<bold>Abstract:</bold></br>The dependence of our society on ever more complex software systems makes the task of testing and validating this software increasingly important and challenging. In many cases, multiple independent and heterogeneous systems form a system of systems responsible for providing services to users, and the current testing automation tools and techniques provide little support for the performance of this task. </br>

This dissertation is part of a larger scale project that aims to produce a Model-based Testing tool that will automate the process of testing distributed systems, from UML sequence diagrams. These diagrams graphically define the interaction between the different modules of a system and its actors in a sequential way, facilitating the understanding of the system's operation and allowing the definition of critical sections of distributed systems such as situations of concurrency and parallelism.</br>

The goal of this dissertation work is to develop one of the components of this project that is responsible for the conversion of UML Sequence Diagrams, describing key system behaviours, into Coloured Petri Nets. Petri Nets are a modelling formalism that is indicated for describing distributed systems by their ability to define communication and synchronization tasks, and by the possibility of executing them in runtime using tools such as CPN Tools. </br>

The objective is to define Model-to-Model translation rules that allow the conversion of models, in order to allow integration with the target system, taking advantage of existing model transformation frameworks (EMF - Eclipse Modelling Framework) and model transformation technologies (Epsilon). With this, we are able to hide the complexity of the system analysis to the user (Software Tester) introducing the possibility of automation, generation and execution of tests from the diagrams of test cases, and presenting the results visually. </br>

The design of such transformation techniques has been the subject of multiple studies, although never fully implemented in a scalable and integrateable way, therefore, the challenge is to implement these rules in an solution that performs this automatic model transformation as a stand-alone software component.</br>

In the implemented solution, UML Sequence Diagrams created with the Papyrus visual modelling tool are converted to Coloured Petri Nets executable with CPN Tools. It were used existing verified meta models for both the input and output. The transformation rules were implemented in ETL (Epsilon Tranformation Language). The most relevant features of UML Sequence Diagrams for modelling distributed systems are transformed into equivalent Coloured Petri Nets that accept the same execution traces (event sequences) as the original models. A case study is also presented to demonstrate and validate the approach.</br></br>

								Alongside this dissertation, a scientific article was developed to complement it. This article has been submitted to the <a href="http://www.modelsward.org/">MODELSWARD 2018 International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development</a> and is currently awaiting results.

								<h3>"Uma App para o Joãozinho"</h3>
								<p>Cross-Platform Mobile game developed for the course of "Laboratório de Gestão de Projectos" at FEUP. A project suggested by the non-profit organization "Um Lugar para o Joãozinho" with the purpose of gathering funds in order to rebuild, requalify and improve the pediatric wing of Hospital S. Joao in Porto. The project was developed using the  <a href="https://unity3d.com/pt">Unity</a> framework, and was meant to use the concept of gamification to incite users to donate to the organization.
								My team's colaboration in this project was discontinued after the course was done and continued by the organization.<br/>

								<h3>Marketing Plan for "Up2Fit" Gym</h3>
								<p>This project is not related with technology at all, it was developed for the course "Marketing" at FEUP and it's objective was to make a Marketing Strategy Analysis of a real business. I decided to showcase this project since it's very different from my other projects and it taught me a lot about the importance of marketing in a real life situation. This study included devicing a marketing plan, analysing the internal and external enviornment of the small gym, analysing the customers and market segment and, finally, defining a marketing strategy accordingly. For this study we used real data provided by the owner and the final strategic decisions were really implemented to (hopefully) help the business grow.

								<h3>Up2Manage</h3>
								<p>Information system using the <a href="http://pt.primaverabss.com/pt/">PRIMAVERA ERP</a>. This project was developed for the course of "Sistemas de Informação" at FEUP and the goal was to understand the complexity of organizational Enterprise systems. The theme was Sales Force Automation so we developed an interactive dashboard webapp to help the Sales Team design sales routes, accept tasks layed out by their Supervisors, input sales data, create reservations and complete Orders. This app would work with the enterprise server dealing with product stock and any data irrelevant for the Sales Team making their jobs easier and more efficient.<br/>

								<h3>Places4All</h3>
								<p>Website to evaluate places and locations according to their acessibility to users with limited mobility. This project was developed for the "Coding for Social Impact" project in the "Laboratório de Desenvolvimento de Software" course at FEUP. This website would combine official audits with user reviews and ratings for different places, keeping the evaluation up to date and providing real-time live information on obstacles on route to access the location. This website was developed using ASP.NET since it was mostly for display purposes, and we developed a small Android app to be used on the official audits, where a certified user could answer a comlpete survey and upload pictures to prove it's ratings.<br/>
